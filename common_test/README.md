# Common Test I. Multi-Class Classification

### Dataset Description

- The Dataset consists of three classes, strong lensing images with no substructure, subhalo substructure, and vortex substructure. The images have been normalized using min-max normalization.

### Task

- To build a model for classifying the images into lenses using PyTorch or Keras.


- For this task, I used these models in PyTorch:
  * DenseNet-161
  * DenseNet-169
  * Ensamble of these models
