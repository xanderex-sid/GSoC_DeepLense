# Specific Test III. Image Super-resolution 

## Task 3.A

### Data Description

- The dataset comprises simulated strong lensing images with no substructure at multiple resolutions: high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR).

### Task

- To train a deep learning-based super resolution algorithm to upscale low-resolution strong lensing images using the provided high-resolution samples as ground truths. Implement approach in PyTorch or Keras.

- For this task, I used techniques like data augmentation, transfer learning, hyper parameters tuning and trained these models:
  * Fast Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (FSRCNN) (Performed Better✅)
  * Laplacian Pyramid Super-Resolution Network (LapSRN)
